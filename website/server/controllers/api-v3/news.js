          A wintery breeze is blowing in from the Sto√Økalm Steppes, and the snow is gently drifting
          down over Habit City. The Winter Wonderland event has begun!

        <h3>Winter Class Outfits</h3>
        <p>
          From now until January 31st, limited edition outfits are available in the Rewards column.
          Depending on your class, you can be an Evergreen Warrior, Bell Mage, Winter Spice Healer,
          or Lantern Rogue! You'd better get productive to earn enough Gold before they disappear.
          Good luck!

        <h3>New Aurora Hatching Potions and the Return of Holly and Starry Night!</h3>
        <p>
          There's a new pet breed in town! Check out the brand-new Aurora Potions and the return
          of Holly and Starry Night Potions to brighten your Winter Wonderland avatar look. Buy
          them from <a href='/shops/market'>the Market</a> and use them to hatch any standard pet
          egg. (Magic Hatching Potions do not work on Quest Pet eggs.) Magic Hatching Potion Pets
          aren't picky, so they'll happily eat any kind of food that you feed them!
        </p>
        <p>
          After they're gone, it will be at least a year before these three Hatching Potions are
          available again, so be sure to get them now!
